the GNU project and Linux are very cool

print working directory, aka Where am I
$ pwd

change directory, aka moving around
$ cd, cd -  

make directory, put my stuff somewhere
$ mkdir 

#when naming stuff no spaces, special characters, lower case, camel casing  

#list, what is in a folder
$ ls

#open or update a file!
$ touch file.txt

nano/for loop/declare a variabel
#!/bin/bash
variable="your name"
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  touch $i.txt
done
echo $variable


mv with wild card
